<h2 id="background">Background:</h2>
<p>Hamiltonian Cycle is a gridPath in graph theory that visits each vertex exactly once.<br>
    Implementing this in the snake game, the snake visits every square on the board exactly once. <br>
    This prevents the snake from ever hitting itself or the wall and will always grow the apple, no <br>
    matter what random location it is generated in except when the field/canvas does not have an even <br>
    number of columns and rows.</p>
<p>This may be easily resolved by adding one HC cycle for even columns or rows and odd columns and rows.<br>
    However, this is very boring, so we will try to implement a code that will allow the snake to generate<br>
    a new HC cycle every time it eats an apple and one that avoids the possibility of hitting itself in the<br>
    cycle where the map does not have even sides.</p>
<h2 id="bugs">Bugs:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <ul> Snake can go through itself if you press the opposite direction fast enough
            <ul> Solution: Add buffer to allow the next input to pass after the body new location update is complete.
            </ul>
        </ul>
