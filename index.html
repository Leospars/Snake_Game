    <h2> Tasks: </h2>

    <h2> Current Features: </h2>    
        <ul> 
            <li> Fully operable Snake Game using user input</li>
            <li> Can use Hamiltonian Cycle </li>
            <ul>
                Hamiltonian Cycle is a path in graph theory that visits each vertex exactly once. <br />
                Implementing this in the snake game, the snake visits every square on the board exactly once. <br />
                This prevents the snake from ever hitting itself or the wall and will always eat the apple, no <br />
                matter what random position it is generated in except when the field/canvas does not have an even <br />
                number of columns and rows. <br /><br />
                This may easily e resolved by adding an if statement to stat the HC cycle in an even position.<br />
                However, this is very boring so we will try to implement a code that will allow the snake to generate <br />
                a new HC cycle every time it eats an apple and one that avoids the possibility of hitting itself in the <br />
                cycle where the map does not have even sides. <br />
            </ul>
            <li> Can use algorithm to eat apple </li>
            <ul>
                <li> It preferentially choses to go right over left and up over down</li>
                <li> and it will not hit itself or the wall unless no other option is available</li>
            </ul>
            <li> Can speed up game </li>
            <li> Buttons added to make snake use AI algorithm rather than user control</li>
        </ul>
    <h2> Bugs: </h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Snake can go through itself if you press the opposite direction fast enough</li>
            * Solution: Add buffer to allow the next input to pass after the body new position update is complete.
        </ul>
